# TOP CHEF

> User guide

Open the project with app/dist/index.html.
Data generated with the node scripts in scrape_data.
Frontend using react in app/src/, I used a generator so there is a lot of boilerplate code.
Implemented the display of the list, with a pagination with state management.

`npm install` before running, I removed node_modules to lower the size.
